# Webiso-app

A modern animated, fully responsive website for **digital agency**, for engaging user experience.

## Technologies used

I have used **MERN** stack to build this web-app

**ReactJS** to build scalable frontend components

**Framer-Motion** to create eye-cachy animations in the components.

**ExpressJS** to serve as backend server.

**MongoDB** to store user data into the database.

## To get started

To run **Backend**
```
npm install (install dependencies)
now add mongoDB url in .env file
npm run dev (run the server)
```
To run **Frontend**
```
npm install (install dependencies)
npm run dev (run the application)
```

### Live demo: https://webiso-app.vercel.app/


## Conclusion

This is a new age animated digital agency website. This could be great starting point to learn animations using framer-motion. In this I have also implemented backend to manage user's data and to store I have used MongoDB —a NoSQL database to retrieve faster data.

Feel free to contribute further in this project
